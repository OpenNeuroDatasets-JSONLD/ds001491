#Flavors
An ‘orange’ (1250kJ/100ml) and a ‘tropical’ (1255kJ/100ml) flavor (Karvan Cévitam) were chosen as stimuli. Typically, these flavors are diluted in water to create a sugar sweetened flavored beverage. Prior to the experiment, participants ware asked whether they preferred orange or tropical flavored beverages. The less preferred flavor was used as the unpleasant stimulus and was mixed with fish sauce (Squid Fish Sauce, 221kJ/100gr, 77% anchovies extract, 20% salt, 3% sugar) to a 1:3 fish sauce to syrup ratio. Subsequently, a range of beverages was made for both the pleasant and the unpleasant flavors by manipulating the flavor concentrations. Concentrations increased logarithmically from a 0.03:1 to 1:1 syrup to water ratio in 12 steps. All beverages were made isocaloric matching the maximum energy density of the pleasant beverage by using the tasteless carbohydrate maltodextrin (Nutricia Fantomalt).
Prior to the MRI session, participants rated the beverages on pleasantness. Based on these ratings, four pleasant and four unpleasant flavor concentrations were selected for the fMRI session. For the pleasant range, the flavor concentration with the (first) highest rating and 3 preceding concentrations was selected, whereas for the unpleasant range, the (first) minimum rating and 3 preceding concentrations was selected. If the highest or lowest rating was among the first 4 concentrations, we chose these first 4 concentrations for the remainder of the study.

#Images
40 images were used from the International Affective Picture System, IAPS. Based on norm scores, we randomly selected images that varied from high to low arousal (HA, LA) and negative to positive valence (NV, PV). The set contained 10 HA-NV, 10 LA-NV, 10 LA-PV, and 10 HA-PV images. Used images:
